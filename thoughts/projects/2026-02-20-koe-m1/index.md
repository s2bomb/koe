# Project: koe-m1

## Purpose
This workspace is a scaffold-only project container for `koe-m1`.
It is prepared for downstream section-based execution once an approved spec is added.
No decomposition or scope interpretation was performed during setup.
Section execution remains blocked until `spec.md` contains `## Section Breakdown`.

## Source of Truth

- `spec.md` - Canonical requirements and section definition (pending approved content)
- `sources/` - Immutable original inputs

## Source Documents

Original inputs preserved in `sources/`:
- `sources/original-request.md` - Original chat request (see `sources/original-request.md:1`)

For specific requirements, link to `spec.md` and source file lines. Do not restate full requirements in this index.

## Section Execution Order

No sections defined yet. Populate from `spec.md` after an approved section breakdown is provided.

## Section Status

No sections available. Stage tracking starts after spec approval:
- research
- api-design
- test-spec
- plan
- implement
- validate
